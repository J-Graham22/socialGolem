# socialGolem

This is a Python script that automatically likes and retweets tweets that contain a shortened Twitter link from members of the Golem Gang eSports team.
Uses the Tweepy Python module to access the Twitter API.

NOTE: There is an import in main.py that says "import private". In my project folder, this is a file private.py that holds all information for authentication for
the Twitter account this script runs on. Obviously, this file was not included in the commit for this project to protect the Golem Gang eSports account.
